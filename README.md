# 50_css_js_mini_projects
This repo contains 50 CSS/ Vinnila JS/HTML mini projects to demonstrate a plethora of styling abilities and design elements.
Each project/folder is independent of the others. 
Run the folder of interest locally to view the HTML web page. 

To run locally: 
  1.) Download or copy the project folder of interest and open it in VS code.
  2.) Open a new terminal and cd (change directory) into that file. 
  3.) Once in the directory, run "start index.html" to have the page open in your browser. 

Notes:
  1.) Connection to wifi or ethernet is not needed to run any folder.
